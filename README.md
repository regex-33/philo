POSIX semaphores are a synchronization mechanism provided by the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard for Unix-like operating systems. They are used to coordinate access to shared resources among multiple processes or threads.

A semaphore is essentially a counter with associated atomic operations for decrementing and incrementing its value. These operations are typically referred to as "wait" (decrement) and "post" (increment).


POSIX semaphores provide a flexible and efficient way to coordinate concurrent access to shared resources, making them valuable for multi-process and multi-threaded programming on Unix-like systems. They are often used in scenarios where mutual exclusion or synchronization is required, such as producer-consumer problems, critical section synchronization, and thread pool management.


The sem_unlink function in the provided code is used to remove named semaphores after they have been created and initialized. Here's why it's used in your code:

    sem_unlink("/forks"): This line removes the named semaphore named "/forks" after it has been initialized and used. This is done to clean up the system resources associated with the semaphore once it's no longer needed. Removing the semaphore with sem_unlink ensures that it won't persist after the program exits, preventing potential resource leaks.

    sem_unlink("/write_lock"): Similar to the previous case, this line removes the named semaphore named "/write_lock" after it has been initialized and used. Again, it's done to release system resources associated with the semaphore and prevent it from persisting after the program exits.

In summary, sem_unlink is used to clean up named semaphores after they have served their purpose, ensuring proper resource management and preventing potential issues with resource leaks. It's a good practice to unlink named semaphores when they are no longer needed to maintain system cleanliness and avoid resource wastage.
