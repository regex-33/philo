POSIX semaphores are a synchronization mechanism provided by the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard for Unix-like operating systems. They are used to coordinate access to shared resources among multiple processes or threads.

A semaphore is essentially a counter with associated atomic operations for decrementing and incrementing its value. These operations are typically referred to as "wait" (decrement) and "post" (increment).


POSIX semaphores provide a flexible and efficient way to coordinate concurrent access to shared resources, making them valuable for multi-process and multi-threaded programming on Unix-like systems. They are often used in scenarios where mutual exclusion or synchronization is required, such as producer-consumer problems, critical section synchronization, and thread pool management.
