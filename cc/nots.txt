Line 2: using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.

for (type variableName : arrayName) {
  // code block to be executed
}
The following example outputs all elements in an array, using a "for-each loop":

Example
int myNumbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
for (int i : myNumbers) {
  cout << i << "\n";
}
